***BlindQuest** is a little Dungeon Crawler in which a sharp eye is much cumbersome compared to a keen ear.*

About the project plan
----------------------

### First goal (and *compulsory*) : Rewrite

#### Done, game available at https://blindquest.ovh/game

Rewrite the [original project in python](https://github.com/guydunigo/BlindQuest) to javascript. Actually, I will not convert it directly, rather will I provide the same features at least.

Upload this first version on the [website](https://blindquest.ovh).

### Second goal : Package

First, make a touch-compatible interface !

I plan to ship it as a multi-platform desktop and mobile app. Surely using a technology like Github's Electron, Ionic, Cordova, phonegap, etc. as it is based on NodeJs and should require no big modifications of the codebase. I have however no experience in these technologies yet.

I will also have to make proper sounds and maps repos.

### Third goal : Planning

The project will then require a little organizing and prioritizing (ie. sort TODO and clean it). Cleaning, reordering, commenting...

During that time, I will think about licensing my work, which also means going through the libraries and all the content I have been using and if they are compatible with the license, etc.

Why not finding someone who can provide the required musics and sounds rather than picking them on the internet.

### Fourth goal : The fourth goal

Coding ! Adding new ideas, and mostly having fun !

----------------------------

About the [TODO list](https://github.com/guydunigo/BlindQuest_Js/blob/master/TODO.md)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> ### What an impressive list! Are you really going to include all these features in the game ? 


I don't think I will. However, you can be sure there will be at least the same ones as in the [original project in python](https://github.com/guydunigo/BlindQuest). Actually, I write every ideas I have about the game in the todo list so as not loose them (is this sentece even English ?). 

> ### But there are some good ideas here ! 


I know, I know, I like them too, but I may not have enough time with my studies... Also some features may prove a bit difficult to code. 

There is something else too : As this game is meant to be audio exclusive, I have to figure out how to make these features *straightforward* for the user's hears. How will he be able to distinguish what's happening with all the noise around ?

> ### What are all those `throw ni;` in your code ?


'ni' stands for **Not Implemented**, so this line means that I need to insert code there (finish, change it, ...).
