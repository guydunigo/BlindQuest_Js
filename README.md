Blindquest
==========

***BlindQuest** is a little Dungeon Crawler in which a sharp eye is much cumbersome compared to a keen ear.*

About the [TODO list](https://github.com/guydunigo/BlindQuest_Js/blob/master/TODO.md)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> ### What an impressive list! Are you really going to include all these features in the game ? 


I don't think I will. However, you can be sure there will be at least the same ones as in the [original project in python](https://github.com/guydunigo/BlindQuest). Actually, I write every ideas I have about the game in the todo list so as not loose them (is this sentece even English ?). 

> ### But there are some good ideas here ! 


I know, I know, I like them too, but I may not have enough time with my studies... Also some features may prove a bit difficult to code. 

There is something else too : As this game is meant to be audio exclusive, I have to figure out how to make these features *straightforward* for the user's hears. How will he be able to distinguish what's happening with all the noise around ?
